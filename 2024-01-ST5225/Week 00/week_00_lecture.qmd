## Structure of the course

- The course consists of twelve 3-hour long sessions
- Detailed syllabus provided on Canvas.
- Week 13 will be a review session.
- Each session consists of three parts:
  - During the **lecture**, I explain the relevant concepts of the week at a fairly high level
  - During the **deep dive**, I go through more details and examples.
  - During **hands-on activities**, you get to work on actual data yourself
- For the deep dive and hands-on activities, I will use VS Code and Jupyter notebooks, and you need to bring your charged laptop to follow.
- There will be 3 graded assignments, each counting 20%
- The final exam counts 40%

## Hands-on activities and coding

- This course will use mostly Python and the NetworkX package.
- Set up a GitHub.com account using your NUS email address.
- If you've already used your NUS account for a personal account, you can convert it into a student account: <https://github.com/edu/students>.

## Installing Anaconda

## Setting Up a Conda Environment

- Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or your terminal (macOS/Linux).
- Create a new environment with the required packages by running:

```bash
conda create --name ST5225 python=3.8 networkx numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
