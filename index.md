## GitHub Projects

* [csgc](https://github.com/lishang-stats/csgc): R and Python packages to calculate centred subgraph count statistics; based on the paper
[“Higher-order fluctuations in dense random graph models”](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-journal-of-probability/volume-26/issue-none/Higher-order-fluctuations-in-dense-random-graph-models/10.1214/21-EJP708.full)
* [RSTISim](https://github.com/aroellin/rstisim): R package to simulate STIs on dynamically changing partnership networks.
* [Reversi AI](https://github.com/aroellin/reversi): Deep Neural Network playing Reversi, trained using AlphaZero-style Monte Carlo Tree Search. Play against a trained version [here](https://aroellin.github.io/apps/reversi/). It's a residual convolutional neural netowork with about 1.4 million parameters. I keep training it on my laptop in the background and I will upload new versions regularly. Let me know if you can beat it!


## A less serious, but important piece of research nonetheless...

* A. Röllin and M. Zilversmit. [A Test in discernment of Scotch whiskey and Cognac brandy among untrained tasters](/doc/whiskycognac.pdf).
